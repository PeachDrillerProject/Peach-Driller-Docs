# 🍑 Welcome to Peach Driller

Peach Driller is an innovative DeFi project on Solana, offering a daily income of up to **8%** and a referral bonus of up to **12%**.

We compare SOL to "Peach."

## What are "Peach"?
"Peach" refers to the digital miners that you hire with **$SOL**, which work continuously to generate rewards. This is just a term we've chosen to make it fun and engaging!

### 🍑 Peach Has No Fixed Price
The number of **"Peach" per $SOL** is dynamic and fluctuates based on the **Total Value Locked (TVL)**. A higher TVL means **fewer "Peach" per $SOL**, and a lower TVL means **more "Peach" per $SOL**. This ensures fairness, preventing early investors from having an unfair advantage. **There is no fixed formula or calculator available to determine this.**

---
## 💰 Daily Earnings
Your **daily return can be up to 12%**, depending on various factors:
- How often you reinvest or **drill**
- The time of your deposit
- The fluctuation of the **TVL**

On average, daily returns range between **6% to 8%**.

### 🍑 Eat Peach
#### What Happens If I Always Claim My Rewards?
If you constantly **claim** your rewards without drilling, your daily percentage will **decrease significantly**. This anti-whale mechanism prevents large investors from draining the **TVL**.

#### Should I Compound 2-3 Times a Day?
Compounding, or **drilling**, increases your future rewards. The more you reinvest, the higher your returns in the long run. However, each action requires **SOL network gas fees**.

#### Profit-Taking and Future Growth
If you claim too often, your **daily percentage** will decrease. A growing **TVL** may also slightly lower the daily percentage as the system adjusts.

---
## ⛏️ Getting Your Investment Back
Peach Driller operates as a **locked rewards pool**, meaning your **initial deposit cannot be withdrawn** directly. Instead, you **earn back your investment over time** through the rewards you accumulate.

---
## 📜 Fees & Sustainability
- **5% Development Fee** is applied to all deposits and withdrawals.
- Standard **SOL gas fees** apply for every transaction, including deposits, withdrawals, and drilling.

#### Does My Peach Amount Decrease When I Claim Rewards?
No! The amount of **Peach** you own **never decreases** when you claim rewards. However, you can **increase** your Peach by making new deposits or using the **Drill** button to reinvest rewards.

#### Is This Sustainable?
Yes! As long as the contract has **TVL**, rewards will always be available. Players who withdraw too aggressively are penalized with decreasing rewards over time, ensuring long-term balance.

## 🏆 Best Strategy: The **6/1 Method**
To maximize returns, we recommend the **6/1 strategy**:
- **Drill (reinvest) for 6 days**
- **Claim rewards on the 7th day**

This method **compounds your investment** and allows you to **recover your initial deposit within 2-3 weeks**.

### 📈 How It Works
You can **drill multiple times per day** to accelerate growth. The more frequently you reinvest, the faster your rewards compound.

## ⚙️ Algorithm & Mechanics
We compare **$SOL** to "Peach."

### Revenue System:
1. Users **deposit $SOL** on the Dapp.
2. Miners generate **Peach**.
3. Users **sell Peach** for profits.
4. Miners work **indefinitely**, allowing ongoing withdrawals **as long as TVL exists**.

### Algorithmic Formula
**Miner Price = Deposit Amount / (Deposit Amount + Contract Balance) * Peach Market**

Because the price of **Peach is dynamic**, early investors have an advantage. However, since **TVL fluctuations affect earnings**, **even late investors** can find profitable entry points.

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Daily interest rates fluctuate** based on various factors.
- **Early investment provides advantages**, but reinvestment also keeps returns high.
- **As long as the contract has a balance, withdrawals are possible.**
